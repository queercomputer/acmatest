              <div class="answer">
                <p>There are three things for you to do.</p>
                <p>1. Fill out the consent form which we need to start you off. This should take about 2-3 minutes. You can access the consent form by clicking <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HB8MBTK">here.</a></p>
                <p>2. Check out the study instructions below (remember that each time you get a scam call or message you should open the link and report it to us).</p>
                <p>Thanks so much for joining this study, we really hope your participation will help us to reduce the number of scam calls and messages Australians are getting.</p>
              </div>

              <a class="question" href="#">How to install the app</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>To make it easy for you, we have an app that you can install. This app will give you an easy to use button on your phone to press every time you receive a scam call or message. The app is very secure, and it will never take any data from your phone that you don’t enter into the app.</p>
                <p>To download and install, follow these steps:</p>
                <p>xx
                xx
                xx</p> 
                <p>If for any reason you can’t install, just use the link we send each day in the daily SMS reminder about the study, either will work just as well.</p>
              </div>

              <a class="question" href="#">How to notify the project when you receive a scam call or message</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>Each time you receive a call or message you think may be a scam, we would like you to fill out a few short details by opening the app or clicking on the secure link we have sent to you as a text/SMS.</p>
                <p>The interface asks a few brief questions, and should take no more than two minutes to complete.</p>
                <h3>First step</h3>
                <p><b>Please enter your unique identifier we have sent you by SMS.</b> This helps us to match your scam experiences with the survey data you’ve already provided, so we can better map where and when people are targeted.</p>
                <p><b>Please also enter your initials.</b> This is so we can error-check against any typo in the unique identifier and to help you with any technical issues that may arise.</p>
                <p><b>What would you like to do?</b> Finally, we ask if you want to report a scam call/message.   
                <p> - Yes: will take you to the reporting page</p>
                <p> - No:  will end the report </p>
                <p><i>If you remember, it’s helpful to let us know at the end of each day if you haven’t had any scam messages, that way we can better track the days when people are most targeted. Hit “No I am letting you know I have had no scam today” and that will end the questions for the day.</i></p>

              <a class="question" href="#">What if I don’t get any scam calls/message each day?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>If you don’t receive any scam calls or messages on any particular day, we ask that you still go into the app and, on the opening page, select “<i>I am letting you know I have had no scam communication/messages today.</i>”</p>
                <p>This will let us know you didn’t get any scam messages, and that you’re still engaged in the study so we can pay you.</p>
                </div>
              
              <a class="question" href="#">Payment</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>After the completion of the study, you will be paid $80 in appreciation of your time and support.</p>
                <p>Just after the 14-day study is complete, we will send you a link to a secure form where you can provide your bank details. RMIT University will then process the payment, which should take a further 7-14 days.</p>
                </div>

                <a class="question" href="#">Technical issues</a>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>If you are having any technical issues, please fill in the brief form <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/5WQS25N">here</a> and one of the team will be in touch by SMS or email, usually within 24 hours.</p>
                  <p>You can also email us with any questions at <a href="mailto:scam.study.2024@gmail.com">scam.study.2024@gmail.com</a></p>

              Touching anywhere outside the "set app badge" button clears badges.
